# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description
This app allows you to take notes in your web browser through a separate page. You can add, view, save, and delete notes at your need. There is also functionality to install the app on your computer.

## Usage
You will need to open the index.html file the first time and/or everytime if you don't install the app. Otherwise if the app is installed you should be able to open it straight through your browser.
